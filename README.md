# SIMD

This repository currently contains a minimal README and an AI agent guidance file.

Files of note:
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` — guidance for AI coding agents on how to explore and safely scaffold this repo.

If you'd like, I can scaffold a minimal project layout (language of your choice), add CI, and include a basic test.
